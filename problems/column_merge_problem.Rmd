## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# libraries
library("kableExtra")
# init
tmp.data = c(
  "Desc1", "Innerdesc1", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
  "Desc1", "Innerdesc2", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
  "Desc2", "Innerdesc1", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
  "Desc2", "Innerdesc2", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
  "Other Text", NA, "Foo", NA, NA, "Bar", NA, NA
)
tmp = data.frame(matrix(tmp.data, nrow = 5, ncol = 8, byrow = T))

tmp

# save latex
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

tmp %>% kbl(
  caption = "Table Name",
  format = "latex",
  align = "llrrrrrr",
  row.names = F,
  col.names = linebreak(c("Level", "Type", rep(c("Cat1", "Cat2", "Cat3"), 2))),
  booktabs = T,
  escape = F,
  linesep = c("", "\\midrule")
) %>% collapse_rows(columns = 1, latex_hline = "none")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
